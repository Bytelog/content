Javascript tooling is a mess. Should we use RequireJS or Browserify to provide modular capabilites? Which works better with gulp? What if I want to use ES6? Discussions on navigating the new frontier of JavaScript [keep popping up](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=javascript%20tooling). Browsers are improving on rendering performance and standards compliance, and rapid growth is a result of that.

That's all great. What isn't so great is that there's so much hype built up around JavaScript and frameworks like Angular that people are creating "Angular Applications" instead of going through the design process and choosing the right tool for the job. 

I'm going to group web applications into three categories: Informational, Interactive, and Commerce. The vast majority of applications are Informational...

* Do not pollute the DOM
* Reduce synchronous dependencies
* Treat HTML as a stand-alone document
* Lean on CSS for user experience
* Test your site with javascript turned off
