Too many internet users take their online privacy for granted. Even developers, I have found, often have very little knowledge of just how much information about themselves is leaked to the websites that they visit.

In an attempt to remedy this in some small way, I've created this page to demonstrate just a few of the things that I believe *you* should be aware of.

Information You've Given Me
---------------------------
```
IP Address: {{ ip }}
Web Browser: {{ browser }}
Operating System: {{ os }}
Last Site Visited: {{ referer }}
Cookies: {{ cookies }}
Geolocation: {{ location }}
```

If these fields are non-informational, congratulations - you've limited what information your browser sends to the websites you visit. Otherise, don't panic! I don't keep any of it. You should, though, be aware of what information you're sharing each time you visit a website.

Google Watches you
------------------
Beyond the information your browser sends to servers, advertising companies do their best to profile users by putting tracking scripts into the ads they place on a variety of sites. They do this so that they can serve content more relevant to you, increasing the likelyhood that you'll click on the ad and thereby increasing their revenue. Do you have a google account? Check out your profile: [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/).

HTTP Headers
------------

The HTTP/1.1 specification (which you have used to reach this page) lists variety of information that is to be sent from your browser to the server that it is connecting to.
